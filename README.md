# keepSomeInventory

Out of all gamerules, keepInventory is the most "cheaty" one. There's no stakes involved; if you die, oh well. By default, though, dying can be *devestating*, losing the armor you spent a good three hours trying to get by mining in the Nether.

This mod makes a compromise. If you die, you can still keep your stuff. It'll cost you, however; half of the remaining durability on all of your items (and half of your levels) will be lost. The stakes are lowered, but not zero; now it's just an annoyance rather than a reason for you to quit your two week Minecraft phase three days in.

This mod can be configured by gamerules. Find 50% too easy? Make it 80% by changing keepDurabilityPercent to 20. Want to still lose all of your levels? Change keepExperiencePercent to 0. Maybe you want to not have full health or hunger on respawn; keepHealthPercent and keepHungerPercent can help you there.

An enchantment is also added, called Ephemeral Resistance. Any item with the enchantment will be resistant to Death's pressure (it bypasses the mod).

This mod plans to be compatible with all mods that put external containers on the inventory; for example, if you have a Traveler's Backpack, items in there aren't safe either. This is a manual process, though; you can report a mod that can cheeze the system [here](https://github.com/thepwrtank18/keepsomeinventory/issues).
